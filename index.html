     Hello everyone, my name is Ben. I am a 4th year Statistics major Economics Minor at UC Davis. My main interests in data science include: making visual representations of data, webscraping and currently learning Python's Tensor Flow module. I hope to use my technical skills for a future career in consulting, but I like to stay open to anything or any opportunity that comes my way! My hobbies include, camping, martial-arts, and photography. Please email me at benjmok@gmail.com if you have any questions. Thank you for visiting my website!

<p>
  I collaborated with my group mates on a project for our web technologies in data science class. We decided to put a spin on our final by mimicking the thought processes of consultants.  We analysed the data and acted as consultants to an advertising firm. We found some pretty effective ways to efficiently allocating capital into different areas and types of advertising.

  <a href = "python1/sfanalysis.html"> <h3>San Francisco Community Analysis</h3> </a>

  <p> 
    This project involves the use of a relational database management systems that carries data about San Francisco.  An RDBMS allows easy access to large amounts of data at any given time.  I use Python and SQL to read and analyze the data. I then make use of the data by depicting graphical representations of different relational factors in San Francisco to answer  specific questions such as: what are the most expensive areas to live in?

  <a href = "python1/articlesscrape.html"> <h3>Natural Language Processing with News Articles</h3> </a>
  <p>
   In this project I used natural language processing to analyze news articles.  First, I used an API to gain direct access to the the data on The Aggie articles using the Python. I then parse the articles as HTML format and use natural language processing techniques to break down the article text into smallers pieces for analysis. I used the similarity matrix, tf-idf transform and visualization to show trends across different types of news articles.

    <a href = "python1/cat.html"> <h3>Shrodinger's Cat... picture</h3> 
  </a>
  <p>
  Here I mathematically break down and restructure the gradients of a picture of an adorable cat. Using Python, I identify the color matrix for each color channel (RGB). I then use the large color matrix to alter and essentially manually photoshop the picture. The results were pretty cool.
  </p>
  
   <a href = "python1/nutritionanalysis.html"> <h3>Nutrition Analysis</h3> 
  </a>
<p>
   Utilizing the USDA API, I scraped for nutrition information on different types of food.  First, I access the API and create multiple functions that search for different types of fruits and vegetables for me. Next, I retrieve JSON elements from those searches and input them into a dataframe.  Then, I create a mathematical model to accurately represent the total nutritional value that a food might have.  I then visualized the relationships between nutritional values and different factors to gain a better understanding of underlying food prices.
