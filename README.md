## About Me

Hello everyone, my name is Ben. I am currently a 4th year Statistics major Economics Minor at UC Davis. Yes, I am graduating soon and I am very excited! I am a firm believer in data science and I love how powerful and flexible data science can be. My main interests in data science include: map making, webscraping and cat pictures. I hope to make use of my technical skills for a future career in consulting but I am open to any work that really floats my :sailboat:!
